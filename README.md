## A simple web game
###### Collaboration with [Leigh Bryant](https://github.com/leighebryant) and [Rob Williford](https://github.com/rswillif)

This was a group project, but we ran out of time and weren't able to connect the backend.

But the game page itself works! Leigh styled the pages and I handled animations and the game code.

Someday this game will support user accounts, leaderboards, and achievements and stuff.

## How to play

An equation will appear on screen.

If the equation is correct, click the 'âœ“' button.

If the equation is incorrect, click the 'x' button.
